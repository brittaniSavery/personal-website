Recently, my sister asked if I wanted to join her Spotify subscription. Sadly, Google decommissioned my previous streaming service (RIP Google Music) and so I was in the market for a new place to play my music. I figured ":shrug: Why not?" To my surprise, Spotify contains dozens upon dozens of video game soundtracks from personal favorites as well as unheard gems.

Hollow Knight, Stardew Valley, NieR:Automata, and Celeste were some of the foundation blocks of my video game soundtracks catalog on Spotify. However, the more I explored and discovered, the more I realized how much of an impact video game music has had on my life, from childhood to now.

There is probably a tie between the Tetris theme song or the Super Mario Bros theme song on which was the first video game track that made an impression on me. I humming the theme songs as I played Tetris on my GameBoy or Super Mario on our Super Nintendo. I wasn't very good at Mario, but Tetris was my jam. Even to this day, I enjoy a quick game of Tetris and use my skills to place food in our tiny freezer. :lol:

Donkey Kong Country was the first soundtrack where I actively noticed each different song

The next influential soundtrack was from NBA Street Vol. 2, possibly one of the best game soundtracks ever, or at the very least, one of the best fits to the style of a game. It perfectly captured the sound of the street with Chief Rocka - Lords of the Underground and The Choice Is Yours - Black Sheep. That soundtrack was one that I heard on near repeat while playing the game during one of the vacations we took to Florida. The rental house we stayed in had its own screened-in, private pool. We went to Disney World and Universal Studios. Yet, my fondest memories of that vacation were staying up and building my custom player to be a league of the street.

Probably around that same time, my siblings and I were attempting—albeit quite badly—to beat Jet Set Radio Future. Each level has a song closely associated with it:

A couple of days ago, I received an email with the subject "The hiring Director of Engineering is interested in your technical expertise." It's nothing uncommon for me to receive an email or LinkedIn message with a similar subject. For the past several years, I have gotten a message from a recruiter asking if I'm looking for a new position at least once a month. With the Great Resignation still going strong and companies having plenty of positions to fill, I sometimes get messages every week. I try my best to reply to each recruiter since I know what it is like to get ghosted, but time may get away from me.

This particular email is an exaggerated example of a style of message I and other professionals have received from recruiters. See if you can noticed what's missing from this email. The name of the recruiters and the recruiting company have be changed, but everything else is completely and absolutely legitimate.

> Hi Brittani, are you still open to new opportunities?  
> My associate Larry at ABC Recruiting forwarded me your info and the hiring Director of Engineering at a successful company I'm currently working with is interested in your technical expertise for a Senior position.
>
> Typically, they do a 30-minute interview.  
> He is available this week Tuesday, Wednesday between 1 pm to 6 pm.
>
> Please let me know what day and time are good for you and I will forward you the details.
>
> What is the best number the hiring Director can call you at?
>
> The salary is excellent with great stock options, bonus, 401K, full benefits and more.  
> This is a great opportunity.
>
> Have a great day and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
>
> Regards,
>
> Bob Smith  
> Client Account Manager  
> ABC Recruiting

Could you tell what was missing? Honestly, it would probably be easier to list the things the email did tell us. A male director of engineering is looking for a senior developer (maybe?). His availability is Tuesday or Wednesday 1PM through 6PM and the interview will probably be 30 minutes. And...that's it. :/

We don't know the name and industry of the company, the type of position (frontend, backend, both?), the technology and languages used by the company, the location of the position (remote or in office and if so, where), and the "excellent" salary and benefits. In order for me to get these details, I would have to agree to an interview with an unknown company for an unknown senior position. That doesn't make sense to me.

As I stated at the start, this is an extreme example of a recruiter message with missing information. However, many of the recruiters that are attempting to recruit me do not list the company's name in their cold call. They may state the industry and general product(s) of the company, which can often allow me to google and discover the company for myself. It's like a secret that is only revealed to those who are deemed worthy. :shrug: Shouldn't recruiters be proud of their clients and let potential candidates know who they may be working for in these "great opportunities"?

I realize that most recruiters are just keyword-searching and throwing a bunch of lines out into the water, hoping for bites. However, it would be nice for a bit more effort to be done on their part by giving me the _full_ job description—company name included since that must be stated—ahead of time instead of getting me on a call that doesn't go anywhere because I don't have the right skills, the right experience, or the right culture fit.

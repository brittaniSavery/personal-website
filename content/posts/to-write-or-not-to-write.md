It's been awhile, huh? Nearly a year has passed since my last blog post. üòÖ Sorry about that. Nothing major has happened, thankfully. This unintentional hiatus was the result of life getting priority: weddings, vacations, work, remodels, and things like these. Now that work has stabilized, the remodels have slowed down, and summer vacations have ended, I actually feel the desire _and_ the motivation to write once more.

Throughout my hiatus, I often thought of my work-in-progress novels, my half-finished short stories, my unwritten poems of the heart. Sometimes the words would come and I would try to write, but as soon as I picked up a pen and paper or opened my [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) program, they vanished on me and barely a shadow of the idea remained. üòï Even journaling was difficult. Only big events managed to convince my brain to write them down.

With the struggles of writing, I started to wonder if I could still call myself a writer. I haven't written anything of significance in several months. Of course, I wrote a novel and several poems throughout the years. However, that was all in the past. My current offerings were like a tumbleweed in the wind. I wanted to finish the sequel to [_Element Unknown_](/book/element-unknown). I wanted to continue working on my other novel set in the same universe. I wanted to stretch my creativity with poetry. The desire was there. I just did not have the energy‚Äîthe motivation‚Äîto write.

I mentioned this to my family one night and my Dad gave me this reassurance, "You wrote a book, didn't you? You've written stuff before, right? So, you'll write again. The words will come eventually. Don't be so hard on yourself." I haven't considered that I was being hard on myself, but looking back, I was. I had this guilt that lingered over me whenever I didn't write but instead did something else: read, play a video game, code. I had multiple people asking me about Book II (no rushing, just genuine curiosity) and I felt as if I was letting them down by not having it completed and published by now.

With time, I stopped being so judgemental on myself for having a little fun by gaming, going down a research rabbit hole, or coding. And the words did eventually come. I can proudly say that I am close to finishing my final draft of Book II before sending it to my editor. I rewrote one chapter and heavily edited another to add more tension and I have just a few more aligning edits to make (removing a character, reworking the outcome, etc.). The draft will be complete before the end of the month. üôåüèæ

If you would to learn more about my editing process, be sure to sign up for my [newsletter](/newsletter)! This will only be the second book I have ever had professionally edited, so I'm still learning a lot myself. I also have made some progress on that other novel in the same universe as _Element Unknown_. Follow along with me as I work through this draft of a brand new series! In any case, once Book II is much closer to publication, I will update everyone on social media.

It's a great feeling to get back into the swing of things. I promise that it won't be another year before my next blog post. üòâ But have you ever felt an overwhelming desire to do something but lacked the motivation? If so, what got you up and going again? Let me know on Instagram, Twitter/X (whatever people are calling it now üôÑ), LinkedIn or any other place you can find me. Until next time!

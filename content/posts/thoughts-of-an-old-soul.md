When I was younger, I had a bunch of people tell me that I had an old soul, meaning that I had a maturity of self and understanding of things beyond my years. I was around two years old telling one of my aunts that she could not piece my ears because she wasn't a professional, childish lisp and all. Starting from age seven, I became interested in history, particularly fond of the _Dear America_ historical fiction series. At age thirteen, I had a solid sense of my future goals and lifestyle. See my previous post, [Work Revisited: "I Am" Poem](/post/work-revisited-i-am-poem), for a great example. Much of my personal taste in clothes, music, and books are usually found in times much older than me. I often joke that I was born in the wrong decade.

Speaking of old books, I spent most of this year finishing (again) _The Complete Stories of Sherlock Holmes_ by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and _Dune_ by Frank Herbert. I love the critical thinking powers of Sherlock Holmes and his friendship with Dr. Watson. The wide variety of situations and cases of Holmes and Watson make for fantastic adventures. In _Dune_, Herbert creates a vivid world, not hesitating to throw the reader right in the middle of it. Yet, we are still carefully introduced to these new concepts just as the main character Paul is as well.

While reading these classic tales, I couldn't help but compare them to the more modern works I had also read throughout the year. _Mask Of The Nobleman_ by Laura Diaz de Arce was gifted to me by the author herself. She asked for reviews in exchange for the free book. It sounded interesting, especially given the retelling of a fairytale I had never heard of before. I enjoyed the character development in the beginning, but I felt the middle rushed the two main characters into a romance, claiming that their love was true and lasting. :shrug: I highly doubt that after only a few months of knowing each other. The end continued the rushed feeling, ending the book on an unsatisfying cliff-hanger. :/ _Rouge Princess_ by B.R. Myers was another fairytale retelling (Cinderella), though it switched things up a bit with a gender-swap of the main characters and a space setting. I enjoyed the space setting but would have liked more world building, such as detailing more of the worlds of the suitors for Princess' Delia. The placement in space could have been utilized more effective in my opinion. _One Word Kill_ by Mark Lawrence I got free as part of Amazon Prime. It has a time-traveling plot and a fun set of characters, but I just couldn't get into it. I stopped at 57% according to the Kindle app.

When searching for my next read, I do try to support my fellow indie authors. However, I'm not drawn to many of their stories due to an inclusion of graphic sex, paranormal themes, or an overall preachy tone to "fight the system." The few books I do find and read rarely capture my imagination as raptly as the classic works such as _Dune_ or _Sherlock Holmes_.

It's similar with most of the new shows and movies. I've currently been rewatching old anime like _Cowboy Bebop_ and _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. I rewatched _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ last year. I also had bit of a _Chopped_ marathon, starting with season 1. The only show I have watched that was released in the last year or so was _The Mandalorian_. Most shows now seem to have more of an agenda, creating characters that fill a certain checkbox rather than a place in the plot. I read, listen, and watch things to escape from reality. If I want to be informed (and probably angry), I'll just watch the news or read Twitter. :shrug:

My own literary work may have an underlining message, just as Herbert had with the _Dune_ series. However, the message does not supersede the plot and characters. To be honest, I really didn't notice a theme in _Element Unknown_ until I tried naming its very first draft. Both Rex and Meenal attempt to discover their places in society; hence I called it _Discovering Ourselves_. :frown: Rather generic. I much prefer its current title. But the plot came before the message and sometimes, I think other creators forget that.

I miss the days where characters were defined by their personality traits and habits rather than their race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. I miss having conflicts based on choices and consequences rather than ignorance and prejudice. I know the importance of these message-filled stories. They should told and shared readily. "There is an appointed time for everything...A time to weep and a time to laugh...A time to love and a time to hate." (Ecclesiastes 3:1, 4) There has been much weeping and hatred, which some of these stories have caused. I think there should be a bit more laughter and love.

:sigh: Maybe I'm a bit optimistic (which is quite ironic). Maybe it's just my old soul, longing for things of the past.

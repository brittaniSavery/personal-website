            <description><![CDATA[I recently turned 30 and I have learned much about myself in the last few years. Here are 30 things for 30 years.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirty: The end of one's youth, the official age of true adulthood, an accomplishment for some, and a dread for others. I know friends that have stressed over their turning 30, frantic about their lack of [insert random societal status symbol].</p>
<p>I turned 30 this August. My sister had asked me how I felt once I hit that infamous age. I shrugged and said, &quot;Same as yesterday. My wrists hurt, my back hurts, and my knees randomly crack.&quot; In all seriousness though, I did not feel any physical difference from my years 24-29. However, I certainly am not in the same mental state as I was five to six years ago, for which I am grateful. In the latter half of my 20's, I have learned a lot about myself, my family, my friends, and the world in general. Here's my 30 for 30 in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Owning a house is a huge accomplishment as well as a huge burden.</strong> When I purchased my house before the age of 30, many congratulated me on this achievement. However, I didn’t view it as a such a big deal. It was simply a financial decision. Now that I have been in my house a few years, I understand the hard work it takes to maintain an entire house. I have actually missed apartment living where I only concerned myself with the interior of my space. The exterior (lawn care, snow removal, etc.) was not my problem; I miss that simplicity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Friends can be from different neighborhoods, cultures, or even generations.</strong> I have always had a wide variety of friends, but I would say that my most recent circle of friends has been the most diverse: some are wives, mothers, or single like me, many come from different countries and speak different languages, and even one graduated high school the same year as my grandmother. As I’ve gotten older, my circle has only extended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Space and time alone to detox from social interactions is a necessity.</strong> The older I get, the harder it becomes to be &quot;on&quot; for long periods of time, meaning becoming the outgoing, personable, and engaging young woman that I am expected to be. I especially noticed this during my time in Gabon. I’m a quiet person who enjoys her time alone. I feel drained whenever I don’t get a chance to rest from socializing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Siblings aren't guaranteed friends but they can be some of the best.</strong> Sadly, quite a few of my friends do not have good relationships with their siblings, which I had previously thought to be unusual. Now rather than looking at the relationships of others with their siblings, I simply treasure my own, happy to call my sister and brother friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pulling all-nighters are a thing of the past.</strong> I recently pulled an all-nighter finishing up a coding assignment for a job interview. I was absolutely dead the next day. So no more all-nighters for me. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:grinning-face-with-sweat"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Romantic relationships can be (and usually are) overly complicated.</strong> I am the first to admit that I don't understand romantic relationships. I have never had a successful courtship and my taste in men tends to border the line of questionable. I prefer things that make logical sense and romance doesn’t seem to be one of those things, so at least for now, I’ll stay happily single.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Being laid-off does not state your worth as an employee; it's just business.</strong> I have been laid off twice within the past three years. It can start to make you question if you are a good employee. I know I did. Friendly reminder: it's just business and business will whatever it can to make money or stop from losing it. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:woman-shrugging-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failing the obnoxious interview process of big name companies is not a sign of your ability as a developer.</strong> Most developers know about the crazy hard interview process from companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and LinkedIn. People study for months in order to even make it past the first round. For whatever reason, these companies have approached me multiple times asking me if I would like to interview with them (more than likely as a diversity hire). A few times I did interview with them and I only made it to the second round once. Yet, I have had a very successful career as a developer, even currently working on Microsoft websites. Sometimes you don’t have the thought-process those companies are looking, but you can find a company that will appreciate your unique skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saving money early opens up grand opportunities for later.</strong> My mother told me early to save at least 20% of every paycheck. Those savings helped me to beat out others when making offers on my house. Save now and benefit later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A dog is a girl's most loyal companion and will be there for her when others cannot.</strong> Meshach, my olde English bulldog, has been by my side for over seven years now. He knows when I’m not feeling the best and refuses to leave my side. He's a good boy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hobbies do not dictate one's gender.</strong> I have traditionally masculine hobbies: software development, sports, video games. I am still a woman though. I just like different things from what others think girls should like. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:woman-shrugging-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get the feelings <em>OUT!</em></strong> Holding feelings inside is not good, so get them out in a healthy way: writing them out, talking them out, dancing them out, whatever works for you. Just don’t let them settle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sometimes it's better to leave old, close relationships behind.</strong> Friends come and go. People change. Relationships morph for better or for worse. If things change for the worse, it's best to leave people behind, even if you both were much closer in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take advice with a pint of salt.</strong> Advice is usually given with the best of intentions. However, that advice might not be good for you in your current set of circumstances. Always listen but don’t be quick to activate the advice. Consider it and either follow directly, make adjustments, or ignore it outright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set goals for yourself, not because of others.</strong> Similarly to the one above it, you may have others such as your family, boss, friends, or even society itself give you goals that you should reach by a certain age or whatever. Goals are a great way to mark your progress, but you may not want to determine your progress by another human’s standards all the time. Sometimes it could be an impossible goal for you but quite achievable for someone else. Set goals for yourself and define the type of person you would like to be. And if that definition matches with what others want, then great! But that doesn’t always have to be the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contentment doesn't come from what you have but from what you think.</strong> Jesus' words at Luke 12:15 is the inspiration for this lesson: &quot;Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of greed, because even when a person has an abundance, his life does not result from the things he possesses.&quot; Some of the most miserable people are also some of the richest and/or most famous. Material things, fame, and the like are not what bring true and lasting happiness. So, I try to keep a simple life and do my best in following Jehovah's laws. This has worked for me and I’m pretty content with life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting professional help can lead to gaining a form of normalcy.</strong> Mental instability had been a staple in my life for years. Thankfully, I found a good combination of treatment from professionals and I am finally mentally healthy. I definitely encourage seeking professional help. You can always start small with just one therapy visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-care can be low-key laziness and that’s okay.</strong> Self-care for some is stretching, yoga, and meditation. For others it could be retail therapy or hanging out with family and friends in a low-stress environment. Though, for me at times, it's just sleep and being lazy in bed or mindlessly watching YouTube. And that's totally okay if it helps you get out of the funk you're in. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:thumbs-up-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Being an adult is much better than being a high schooler or college student.</strong> This is one on which many may disagree with me. I did not enjoy my high school experience and college was a means to an end. As an adult, I get to do what I want when I want for the most part. I have so much more freedom as an adult and would never go back to being a student in long-term schooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Small things make me happy.</strong> A new package of pens, a custom notebook for the next large assembly, windows-down car rides, warm puppy cuddles...I like simple things. They make me happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emojis are necessary for text-based communication.</strong> Sarcasm and other emotions are completely lost in text-based communications. Emojis help to fill in the missing information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crowds are scary. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:downcast-face-with-sweat"></span></strong> While I love gathering with my spiritual brothers and sisters at the assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses, I have terrible social anxiety and despise the large crowds. I still try to meet new people at each assembly, so my go-to trick is find someone with a relaxed expression not surrounded by a bunch of people. Older folks are usually a good pick for this trick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publishing a book is easy; making money from it is hard.</strong> Self-publishing a book is actually not that hard. Maybe a bit time-consuming (going through an editor, getting a custom cover, checking and double-checking for typos) but once it's on the web, that's it. Now the real test begins: making people know about it and getting people to buy it and hopefully review it. If you like Young Adult Science-Fantasy, you might enjoy <em>Element Unknown</em>. You can buy an <a href="/element-unknown">autographed paperback</a> from me or head over to <a href="http://amzn.to/2vSpcxR" target="_blank">Amazon</a> for the eBook.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Journaling is a great way to relive awesome memories and to review hard lessons.</strong> I have been journaling for years, my earliest typed entry being from 2008. I like to reread some of my old entries and smile at the good times and cringe at the bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Family dynamics will change as you age.</strong> Most know that the relationship with your parents will change when you get married. However, I have noticed that my relationship with my parents have changed despite my single status. While I am still their child, I am not a child and thus, they treat me as a fellow adult—most of the time. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:winking-face-with-tongue"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invest in a good chair and a spacious desk.</strong> If you work from home or spend a bunch of time on the computer, invest in a big desk and a comfy chair with back support. I have no room on my little desk but I recently got a lightly used gaming chair from a guy on Facebook Market and it has saved my back. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:thumbs-up-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your diploma means nothing, but the mastery of Google-fu is critical.</strong> I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and learned much about computing and math. Do I use much of the knowledge I gained during college? NOPE! Do I use Google nearly everyday to overcome coding issues? YEP!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Someone's facial expression (or lack thereof) is not always a good indicator of their current mood.</strong> I have a strong case of resting-mean-face. When others ask me if everything is okay, I usually answer back, &quot;Yes, I'm fine. It's just my face.&quot; Sometimes, a person is not upset. Sometimes, it's just their face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If I don't like the way a website works, I can probably make something that better suits my needs.</strong> My website currently uses <a href="https://www.wix.com" target="_blank">wix.com</a> and it served me well enough until I extended my website's focus. Wix unfortunately has slowed down significantly and makes updating my blog a bit painful. I will be moving away from it soon to something I build. In the long run, I think it will be easier for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be willing to take some well researched and calculated risks; never know how things will turn out until you try.</strong> Switching congregations, changing jobs, buying a house, traveling to Africa...all were risks but many turned out well. Wouldn’t have known if I didn't try.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Coming up with 30 things was hard! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:grinning-face-with-sweat"></span> What are some things you've learned about yourself recently? See if you can do a 20 for 20, 30 for 30, 40 for 40, 50 for 50, etc. Until next time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Having written poetry for 18 years, my skills as a poet have improved greatly. I compare some of my work with earlier versions of itself.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In between starting a new job, supporting the web design needs of a local non-profit, <a href="https://www.hallinscorp.com" target="_blank">HALLINS Corporation</a>, and even dealing with a surprise paperback purchase (which was awesome once I realized the email wasn't spam <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:grinning-face-with-sweat"></span>), I've haven't had much time to write for me. Granted, I have not been the most inspired to write creatively, as mentioned in my last post. However, I decided to open up the file where I keep all my poetry, mainly to fix some formatting issues. The seemingly absent-minded task transformed into a trip into my past as I reminisced on the topics, styles, and quality of my poetry.</p>
<p>The earliest poem that I have saved was from 2002 entitled &quot;Today is the Day.&quot; I don’t have the month or day unfortunately, but I do remember being in school, starting my first year of junior high (7th grade). I originally shared the poem with my family during dinner or right after it and they liked it, encouraging me to continue writing. It's about a runner training, winning, and remembering a race they entered. Looking back at it now, it isn't the best poem. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:woman-shrugging-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span> But, it was a start.</p>
<p>For the last 18 years, I have written at least one poem each year. Some years only have two or three poems where others contain dozens. Seeing how poetry was my main source of de-stressing for years, you can easily tell when life got a bit crazy. Some of my best poems were between the years of 2013-2015 where I was dealing with difficult changes in my friendships and romantic relationships. These poems are quite personal and only a handful have been read by others. Those poems I didn't write to share but to release the turbulent emotions dwelling inside me. I'm not the best at verbally expressing my feelings, so written word it is then. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:writing-hand-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
<p>One of my favorite poems from that time is &quot;Returned Jackets&quot;, a tribute to the men, or &quot;jackets&quot;, that a friend and I had left behind without continuing onto marrying them, i.e. the final purchase. My friend loved it at the time and despite its age, I think it still holds up pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've returned our jackets, my friend and I.<br />
We both changed our minds right before the buy,<br />
or rather the jackets somewhat forced our hands.<br />
See, further research revealed some things about the brands.<br />
Her former brand was great with her shape flaunted and caressed,<br />
until the poor thing started unraveling due to being highly stressed.<br />
Mine was pretty nice too but with some spots here and there,<br />
but despite washing, the spots became far too big and ugly to wear.</p>
<p>So, we are free, happy, and jacket-less.<br />
Window shopping is actually fun again. Oh yes!<br />
The styles of jackets have all sorts of colors and sizes<br />
and the availability changes with the sunrises.<br />
We admire the pretty ones, the cool ones, and the slick,<br />
careful to avoid the pricey ones who would weigh us down like bricks.<br />
Sometimes, my friend hopes her old favorite becomes free again.<br />
But me, we both deserve better, especially now compared to then.<br />
I sometimes doubt I will ever find one that actually fits.<br />
But then she reminds me of Jah, saying on him to never call quits.<br />
Nevertheless, until we both receive our personalized rewards,<br />
we have each other, jacket-less and never bored!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one thing that I find ironic is that I have only written five poems this year even though life has been a dumpster fire for the past few months. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:woman-shrugging-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span> I have missed writing poetry though and my sister gave me a suggestion of writing a poem a week, whatever subject or styles I want, as a way to jumpstart my creativity again. It's a good idea, one that I'll be starting this month. Feel free to take it if you feel like you're in a creative rut. If you have gotten out a rut recently, what worked for you? The more ideas, the better for me. Until next time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[While my inspiration for coding has been free-flowing, my writing muse has disappeared. A comic perfectly portrays my feelings on my lack of writing.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My personal-coding-project kick is still in full swing! Currently, I have been focusing on one project, the lineage database for my digital dragons (Dragon Cave Lineage Database or DCLDB for short). It's actually up and running at <a href="https://dc-lineage-db.vercel.app" target="_blank">dc-lineage-db.vercel.app</a> if you're curious. I recently completed authentication with <a href="https://swoopnow.com/" target="_blank">Swoop</a> and <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/" target="_blank">Passport</a> (which I might do a blog about later) as well as the ability to add and view lineages. Im still working out the kinks on searching, mainly displaying the results. Tables are hard to get right, especially when trying to make a site mobile-friendly. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:downcast-face-with-sweat"></span></p>
<p>I'm making good progress on my site, I'm staying motivated to finish it, I'm learning new techniques, and I'm even getting some use of it now despite the work-in-progress status. So why do I feel a huge pang of guilt while working on this project? A recent comic from <a href="http://instagram.com/chrishallbeck" target="_blank">Chris Hallbeck</a> sums up my feelings perfectly.</p>
<p class="has-text-centered"><img src="/images/posts/big-project-full-comic-smaller.png" alt="The &quot;Not Done&quot; Comic by Chris Hallbeck, originally posted on 14 Sep 2020" /></p>
<p>In the comic, one guy is working on a small project and a friend comes along and says that it's looking pretty good. But the one working on the project says he could do better. The friend asks, &quot;Are you sure you aren't just using this as an excuse to avoid working on something else?&quot; The question is ignored as the guy keeps working on the small project, saying &quot;Just. A. Few. More. Tweaks,&quot; all the while a huge, badly damaged and barely patched-together rock labeled &quot;BIG IMPORTANT PROJECT&quot; looms over him. Upon seeing this comic, I immediately showed it to my sister, telling her that this is how I feel whenever I work on my coding projects instead of working on the sequel of <a href="/project/element-unknown"><em>Element Unknown</em></a>.</p>
<p>Friends and family who are excited to get the sequel have asked me how my book is going and I say that I'm nearly done (which I am), but that it's been tough to stay inspired (which it has). I am about 85% done. Just about every important event is already written and now I'm just going back to add detail or to clean up some awkward sentence structure. I am just as excited to finally see the words &quot;The End&quot; on draft number one. But I feel a sense of overwhelming dread each time I think about opening up the draft on my computer. I just kinda nope out of it and start coding instead. Hence why I have a nearly functioning database in 3.5 months despite not knowing the framework beforehand and only working a few hours each week.</p>
<p>While my desire to type the sequel has basically vanished, my desire to write the sequel remains, albeit in limited quantity. I have written some scenes by hand in a notebook. Just a little here and there. Having the idea of where I want to story to go clearly in mind definitely helps (new pens help too). I can picture the scenes playing out in my head. The words themselves are having difficulty leaving my brain and transferring themselves onto the page. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:crying-face"></span></p>
<p>I originally had the goal of finishing the first draft by the end of this year. At this rate, I have no idea if that will happen. I'm going to keep trucking along in writing the sequel as well as coding my projects. Maybe one creative process with bleed into the other.</p>
<p>How have you all been during these turbulent months? Is your motivation or inspiration zapped? If so, you're not alone and hopefully soon, we'll be able to get out of this blah mood together. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:thumbs-up-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 02 Sep 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[I've been a nerd for years and this post gives a brief introduction to that side of my personality.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nerd was once an insult of high disregard. Glasses, braces, expertise in math and science, consumer of all books fantasy and science fiction. That description fitted me perfectly during my youth and while I wasn't always the first to accept it, I have been a part of nerd-dom pretty much since 7th grade.</p>
<p>Role-playing, the text-based collaborative writing as mentioned in a previous blog, was a very nerdy and unpopular hobby of mine. While I didn't dress up as my characters, I did often create pixel drawings of them and created one-shot side stories between them. Whenever I explained it to others, I got the same &quot;Yeah, okay weirdo&quot; look from most people.</p>
<p>Star Wars, Star Trek, X-Men (especially the old 90’s cartoon) were just some of my favorite franchises, though two of them leave a lot to be desired today. I'm just not a fan of the new Star Wars or Star Trek. I'll stick with the stuff from my younger years.</p>
<p>I love pens, from the super fancy ones that you only use to sign things all the way down to the regular black ball point. Currently, I've recently discovered <a href="https://amazon.com/gp/product/B000J09CO6" target="_blank">Paper Mate Flair Felt Tip Pens, Medium point (0.7mm)</a>. The bright colors and smooth writing always puts a smile on my face. (This is not sponsored; I just really like these pens.) I jokingly say that people should just give me gift cards to Office Depot. No but seriously, easiest way to make me happy is to give me a good pen or set of pins.</p>
<p>I get excited when I find a new font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> or <a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank">DaFont</a>. I like making custom notebooks for the large conventions I attend with my spiritual brothers and sisters. I enjoy fiddling with new technologies or packages in my personal coding projects.</p>
<p>There are plenty of times when I am rambling on about some new thing I found and my family would call me a nerd. It used to irritate me, but I’ve learned to accept and embrace it. After all, normalcy is overrated.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[I've been working on a new coding project and ran into some issues when using Next.js and Material UI but thankfully found another solution using the CSS framework, Bulma.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been on a personal-coding-project kick lately. Two projects are currently in the works and one is muddling about in my mind. The project discussed in this blog post will be a database for the lineages of my digital dragons from the site <a href="https://dragcave.net/" target="_blank">DragCave.net</a>. It is as nerdy as it sounds. You collect pixel dragons and can breed them together to create all sorts of lines and combinations. The reasoning for this project is that I was tired of using a Google Sheet that took forever and a day to load. Also, searching for anything more complex than name or breed was hard.</p>
<p>I decided that I would also make this a bit of a learning opportunity, so I picked a new React framework to use. I decided to go with Next.js, an apparently developer-friendly framework that supports server-side rendering out of the box. It’s easy to get started using create-next-app with npm (or yarn if you prefer).</p>
<p><code>npx create-next-app</code></p>
<p>I made progress on my site, setting up pages and adding routes. Eventually, I needed to style the app because things need to be pretty. I originally went with Material UI since I have enjoyed using it for work. It has a wide variety of components, which can be easily customized. Normally to use Material UI, you only have to include the <code>@material-ui/core</code> package to your React app, add a ThemeProvider around the start of your app (normally located in <code>app.js</code>), and you're good to go. However, there is a bit more needed to get Material UI to render sever-side with Next.js. You have to add the following to the <code>_document.js</code>.</p>
<pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx">MuiDocument<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function-variable function">getInitialProps</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">ctx</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Once I added that, things went smooth enough. But then as I kept building out the app, I ran into a more and more errors, like console warnings and npm errors when adding other packages or starting the development server. Eventually, I got frustrated enough to restart building it with a different styling solution.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank">Bulma</a>, a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox. It was included in the template I used for the second personal coding project I'm working on. I like how it has variables to easily customize it, has components similar to Material UI, and it works seamlessly with Next.js. I added the necessarily packages and the <code>.scss</code> file for customization. And...that's it.</p>
<p>Since it has been easier to work with Bulma, I've been able to change the colors and fiddle with the wording a bit, but here's the home page in the two different styling frameworks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/materialui-bulma-compare.png" alt="A comparison of the home page using the Material UI Framework and the Bulma Framework" /></p>
<p>If you're a non-coder and made it to the end, thank you for reading my complaints of software development. Let me know which home page you like. Until next time!</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[In Part 3 of the Introduction of Me Series, I talk about growing up with video and computer games and seeing the changes in the industry.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Video games have only been recently pushed into the mainstream, but they have been a major part of my life. During my early childhood, my dad was heavily into video games. My first gaming console was the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or SNES. My cousins, siblings, and I would spend hours playing Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Donkey Kong Country, and Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Sports Challenge. Yoshi's Island was ridiculously hard and the crying baby Mario always made me so frantic. Donkey Kong Country was my favorite. Awesome music, funny characters, and mine kart mania, what more can a gamer ask for?</p>
<p>Despite Daddy saying that we had a Sega Genesis, I don’t remember it. I honestly remember playing the Sonic games at my god-brother's house rather than my own. The next console I actually remember having at home is the Nintendo 64. We had a wide variety of games on the 64: WWF WrestleMania 2000, Pokémon Stadium, Ridge Racer 64, Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt. One of my favorite memories was Daddy finding the character customization codes for recreating Eminem, probably my favorite rapper at the time, in the wrestling game. I was so excited he managed to find that online. The original wrestler I made and Eminem were tag team partners and won the championship in the campaign mode. Being a close second is the bragging and smack-talking between my siblings and me while playing the mini-games in Pokémon Stadium.</p>
<p>Next up was the Sega Dreamcast, a system ahead of its time. Sonic Adventure 2 is the best 3D Sonic game, hands down. And I cannot begin to count the numerous hours I spent in the Chao Garden, raising chao and unsuccessfully figuring out the competitions they could enter. Space Channel 5 created my love for rhythm games. My sister and I would switch off levels and imitate word for and word and pose for pose as we played. Crazy Taxi brought the arcade stands found at restaurants home but kept the same wild fun. Tennis 2K2 (also known as Virtua Tennis 2) is the best Tennis game, allowing for creating your own custom characters and playing with and against the best tennis players. So many memories created by that beloved system and I really wished it didn't get snuffed out by the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>But speaking of the Playstation 2, we had both the original Xbox and the Playstation 2. I have never been picky with my systems. I'm more partial to one that has the better games. Favorite games during this generation were Need for Speed: Underground (the soundtrack and the speed! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:smiling-face-with-heart-eyes"></span>), the Dead or Alive series, Burnout, SSX Tricky and SSX 3, Tony Hawk's Underground, Dance Dance Revelation (especially MAX2), Animal Crossing: City Folk on the Wii, and Rock Band. My cousin Isaiah screaming &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; and being banned from singing in Rock Band, tricking out my car in Underground, pulling all sorts of crazy tricks while snowboarding or skating, and finally beating some of the harder songs on Standard in DDR are just the beginning of the memories built playing the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Wii.</p>
<p>Around this time, I started to become more involved in computer gaming. Most of it was spent playing Sims and creating long generations of families. I did become bored with Sims and wanted to branch out and try some of the games by smaller or independent companies featured on the YouTube channels I watch. Recently, I have been playing Stardew Valley with the newest update of 1.4. I've also been playing Into the Breach and Autonauts. I got my eyes on an early-access game called Space Haven, a colony management simulation set on a fleet of spaceships.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to PlayStation 5 and the new generation of games. But I'm just as excited for the next update of Stardew Valley, a game made by one guy. From humble beginnings to the advancements made in the industry, it's awesome to have grown up together.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[In March, I had my first author interview, which was hosted by VS Holmes from the Amphibian Press Podcast! It was a fun conversation.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have gone through plenty of interviews, especially in the last few months. With the loss of my previous job, I was interviewing with several companies two or three times a week. I do not recommend this. Even if you are desperate for income, I strongly advise breaks. Interviewing is tiring work.</p>
<p>There is one interview that sticks out from the rest, one that I really enjoyed doing. It was my first interview as an author, promoting my books and discussing my writing process. My interviewer was VS Holmes from the Amphibian Press Podcast. We are a part of a pair of Facebook groups for fantasy and science fiction readers. She advertised interview openings for authors that belonged to the groups and so, I signed up. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:smiling-face"></span></p>
<p>March 10th, the day of my interview had finally arrived and I was nervous! I've never been one for public speaking. My preferred form of communication is text-based. But in the end, it was just a nice conversation. Holmes is an excellent host and made me feel at ease. We talked about <em>Element Unknown</em> and its sequel, programming and its effect on my creativity, and the what-ifs in fiction. The interview actually lasted longer than anticipated since the conversation just kept flowing!</p>
<p>If you're curious to hear the full interview, check out the <a href="https://podcast.amphibianpress.online/episodes/element-unknown-and-parallels-of-programming-with-brittani-s-avery" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Until next time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Can creativity be more than drawing and singing? This post explores how imagination and its limits affect what's considered a creative work.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone calls another &quot;creative,&quot; what specific skills come to mind? For a lot of people, creativity is first and foremost aligned with the traditional visual arts such as drawing and sculpting. Others think of performing arts like singing and dancing before anything else. While visual and performing arts are indeed creativity, they are but a small beginning. Creativity is &quot;the ability to produce or use original and unusual ideas&quot; or &quot;the use of the imagination or original ideas.&quot; One's imagination is only limited by oneself. An experience from my software development career clearly demonstrates this.</p>
<p>I was interviewing with different teams at one of my jobs early in my career. Around the middle of one of these interviews, my potential teammates asked me why I enjoyed programming or something to that effect. I explained that I enjoyed the creative process of coding, using different techniques and styles to solve problems. I loved seeing each developer's unique coding style, like a sort of signature. The interviewers laughed at my answer and moved onto their next question without any acknowledgement.</p>
<p>That team seemed to only view coding as a means to an end rather than the creative work it is. Their imagination was limited to the fact that imagination is required in the making of websites, programming languages, software applications, databases, etc. They all started out with an idea. After all, creativity is &quot;the use of the imagination&quot; and &quot;the ability to produce original or unusual ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>Every activity has the potential to be creative. Find the more unusual or non-traditional forms of creativity. Explore them further, either with others or by yourself. If you do or have already done so, let me know! I would love to hear about it. Until next time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[My imagination has played a huge part in my growth as a writer. In Part 2 of the Introduction of Me Series, I'll describe how the stories in my head found an exit.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My imagination has been brilliantly creative probably since birth. One of my parents' favorite story from my toddlerhood is how I entertained myself while in timeout. Apparently, I did not realize that it was a punishment. I took off my shoes and socks, placed the socks on my hands, and held conversations with my new sock friends. I was thoroughly entertained as well as my parents despite their choice of discipline failing.</p>
<p>Playing secret agent in the living room, traveling through portals with ancient keys at my grandmother’s house, and creating soap operas with my stuffed animals and toys continued to feed my imagination throughout the years. Eventually, the stories found their way onto paper. The inspiration for one story I wrote in fifth grade came from anthropomorphic characters based on a How-To-Draw book. I actually never followed the directions of how to draw them. I just traced the characters and then gave them personalities based on their appearances. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:woman-shrugging-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>
<p>Prior to entering high school, I didn’t share my writing often, usually only cringey poems dedicated to crushes. While my family always encouraged me to express myself, they thoroughly admitted not being very creative in a literary sense. I didn’t have a safe place to share my work or experiences with other writers. Thankfully, I found two places where I could express myself and further develop my writing skills and creativity: the Fine Lines Writing Club and various online role-playing forums.</p>
<p>Fine Lines was my high school’s creative writing club and it introduced me to some of my closest friends during those tumultuous years. It also validated my talent as a writer. The host teacher encouraged me to enter a writing contest. A poem of mine was printed in the school’s creative writing magazine. During readings, my fellow student writers commended my unique stringing of words and vivid descriptions. I enjoyed writing, but I finally had the confidence to declare myself a good writer.</p>
<p>The text-based role-playing community provided me the fanciful and fantastic worlds of others to play around in. I could be a half-fairy/half-human with healing powers, a former child solider from 1987 transported to a mysterious land where time stood still, a huggy, redheaded mathematics student who can transform into a Canadian Eskimo Dog, a nerdy, pale, and square engineer and his birth-bonded guardian, a big-boned mahogany-skinned woman with bright golden hair and eyes and a loud personality to match. The possibilities were limitless. With role-playing, I took chances with different types of backgrounds and personalities, learning how to research to build more relatable and believable characters.</p>
<p>I graduated from high school and thus Fine Lines. Free time became more scarce and so, I had to give up role-playing as well. I found different ways to keep writing, creating new characters, stories, and even what-if scenarios between my former role-playing characters. One of those what-ifs actually turned into my first novel, Element Unknown.</p>
<p>I don't have major aspirations with my writing. It is more of an outlet for my emotions and imagination. Though, it would be cool if one of my novels gained popularity and had its own fandom. It would be awesome if the world was so engaging that others made a role-playing forum after it. But a published novel with a solid positive rating is definitely something to be proud of.</p>
<p>What's your favorite type of writing to read: poetry, novels, short stories, plays? If you write, what's your favorite to write? Let me know! Until next time. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:waving-hand-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[Sometimes the motivation of a creative person disappears out of nowhere. Here is a recent personal experience and how none should worry if inspiration is a little unreliable.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently finishing the first draft of my second novel, the sequel to <a href="/element-unknown"><em>Element Unknown</em></a>, also known as Book II. I have the entire story written. I am rewriting certain sections due to changes made earlier in the book and timeline issues. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:downcast-face-with-sweat"></span> I was making good progress, working little by little after the day's responsibilities were done. I was excited to write and see what happens next. I wanted to finish it, print it, and read it for myself from start to finish.</p>
<p>BOOM! Corona hit. I lost my day job at a place where I enjoyed the work, liked my teammates, and worked from home. It happened on a Thursday and so, I decided to take a tiny vacation to visit family and forget about my current troubles. However, that following Monday I hit the ground running so to speak: applying, researching, coding, and interviewing. My main concern was finding a new job. I had little motivation to write much, not even poems which are usually my go-to during turbulent times.</p>
<p>I did eventually find the inspiration to continue working on Book II. Can you guess when? When I accepted a new job and signed the paperwork, nearly three months later. I think I wrote about two chapters. Were they good chapters? Maybe. I definitely liked the rewrite I did for a pivotal point in the novel. Have I written more of Book II since then? Nope! Anxiety due to what has happened in Minneapolis and Omaha, two cities close to my heart, has zapped away my desire to write creatively.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is motivation can be affected by circumstances outside of your control: the loss of work, the betrayal of a close friend, the stress of life, etc. Don't feel bad or beat yourself up if you're not up to doing something creative, even if it is something you love. Muse is a fickle thing.</p>
<p>If you've experienced something similar, I would love to hear about it. Until next time!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[May is Mental Health Awareness Month and while I am glad that mental health gains some more exposure during the month, it is important throughout the entire year. I detail how common mental illness is and how simple actions can help those who suffer.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May is Mental Health Awareness Month and all around social media, one can see various corporations, celebrities, and influencers posting about the importance of mental health. But as soon as May ends, most of the conversations stop. The next big holiday or theme becomes the new focal point.</p>
<p>Mental health complications have affected me personally, not just in some specific month out of the year but many months in many years. Eventually after getting professional help, I was diagnosed with chronic depression, allowing me to finally put a name to the nothingness I felt on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I know that my situation is not unique. A study from 2017 estimates that 792 million people lived with a mental health disorder during that year, which is slightly more than one in ten people globally*. I can only imagine that number has gone up in recent years, especially given the current global pandemic. I look forward to the near future of when no one will say, &quot;I am sick.&quot; (Isaiah 33:24) But until that day, there are little things that anyone can do to help those affected by dealing with mental illness. These can be done at any time, not only during Mental Health Awareness Month.</p>
<p>How you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be open to discuss mental illness, therapy, and related topics in a non-threatening environment</li>
<li>Let others know you will be there for them whenever they’re ready to talk</li>
<li>Research and learn more about mental illnesses, especially ones that affect your loved ones</li>
<li>Endorse professional help</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay healthy. Stay safe. Until next time! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:waving-hand-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[In the Introduction of Me Series—Part 1: The Coder, I will discuss how my background led me to become a software engineer, i.e. a coder.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), specializing in Internet Technologies. Basically, that means that I have a piece of paper that says I know how to make computers do stuff. I didn't really need that as proof for myself; I've been working with technology since childhood.</p>
<p>Some of my earliest memories of technology include watching my father build computers by hand. I played around with the motherboards and pretended they were miniature cities. I would go to work with my mother and she would walk me through some of her email liaison work as a business analyst. I mastered typing and 3rd grader knowledge through the JumpStart computer games. I made spray-can masterpieces and pixel dolls in Microsoft Paint.</p>
<p>I don't remember my first created website. One of my earliest had to be my BlackPlanet page, which was a Myspace for Black folk. If you’re too young to know what Myspace was, just Google it. It was a customizable Facebook with music and glitter everywhere. It was great, trust me.</p>
<p>Using the tools I had on hand, I kept playing around with websites and graphics. I even created multiple websites with different personas or topics. One of my favorites was Brown Eyes Looking, a website based around the pixel dolls I had created throughout the years.</p>
<p class="has-text-centered"><img src="/images/posts/brown-eyes-looking.jpg" alt="Home Page of Brown Eyes Looking, website created in my youth featuring my pixel dolls" /></p>
<p>For my senior year in high school, I decided to take an actual computer programming class. My memory is fuzzy as to exactly why, but I think it was suggested by a counselor as a complement to the computer graphics class I wanted to take.</p>
<p>Mr. Thyden, my programming teacher, noticed a natural talent within me and invited me to join the school’s competitive programming team. I accepted since it was another extracurricular activity, a plus on scholarship applications. Though, I must be honest. I was not good at the contests. The puzzles didn’t click with me (still don't). I hated the restrictions in time, eating, and restroom breaks. Despite my mediocre performance in the programming contests, Mr. Thyden still encouraged me to strongly consider a career in software development.</p>
<p>Since I actually enjoyed coding, I took his advice and did some research on the industry. I saw that the demand for developers would be high for years and the local university, UNO, had a very good computer science program. Getting a full-ride scholarship also helped in cementing my choice of university. So, in August 2008, I started college with a major in computer science and never looked back.</p>
<p>I have been in all sorts of different sub-industries (manufacturing, transportation, insurance, etc.) and I have worked on all parts of the stack, meaning I can build a complete website and manage any databases associated with it. If you have any website questions or projects you need a hand in, I do freelance work. <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:smiling-face"></span></p>
<p>Would I ever change occupations? Probably not, unless it was to be a full-time writer, a <strong>well-paid</strong> full-time writer. I'm already a starving artist when only counting my book sales.</p>
<p>What do you all do for a living? Have you changed industries or occupations? If you haven't, why not? If you could, would you and why? Just curiosity speaking. Until next time! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:waving-hand-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[I am a multifaceted woman, yet my website only reflected one side of me. I decided to change that. Here's the why and how of that process.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new and improved website of Brittani S Avery! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:party-popper"></span> With this comes a new design, a simplified menu, and a weekly blog.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I decided to make all these changes in the first place. After all, my previous design and layout accomplished its goal of informing people of my books and myself as an author. But that's just the thing, I am more than an author. I'm also a software engineer and graphic designer. A website bearing my name should show all the different hats that I wear and that's what I did with these new changes.</p>
<p>The catalyst for the changes was a photo, specifically a selfie from a special (and virtual due to COVID-19) event, <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/memorial/" target="_blank">the annual commemoration of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice</a>. My sister had done my makeup, creating a beautiful sunset effect around my eyes, and my new glasses gave me quite the sophisticated look. This latest photo was much more reflective of my appearance and personality than my current professional photo. This got me thinking if my website could give a more accurate picture of me.</p>
<p class="is-pulled-left"><img src="/images/logo-initials.svg" alt="A feather and the initials 'BSA' between greater-than and less-than symbols, the Brittani S Avery logo" /></p>
<p>I started with the logo. I wanted to combine two big parts of my life: writing and coding. Many associate writing with a book, a notebook, a pen—or better yet, a feather pen! Thus, one part of my logo was complete. The second part comes from a common symbol used to represent a code snippet, <code>&lt;/&gt;</code>. Also, html tags have the following format: <code>&lt;example&gt;random words&lt;/example&gt;</code>. So, I decided to replace the slash with the feather pen and use my initials to create my new logo.</p>
<p>With the new photo and logo in place, I continued to look for ways to reflect my whole self. I maneuvered the About page into the Home page, reworded the Books page to Projects, included my current software projects, and finalized my newsletter. The new and improved website was complete!</p>
<p>So, what can you expect topic-wise? Mostly writing, coding, and the mixture of the two. I might relate some of my personal experiences regarding mental health and being a Black woman in a predominantly male field. This will be a healthy mix of personal and professional.</p>
<p>Sign up for my newsletter to stay up to date on blog posts. There will also be sneak peaks on upcoming projects like the sequel for <a href="/element-unknown"><em>Element Unknown</em></a>. Let me know in the comments below if there is anything specific you would like me to write about. Until next time! <span class="iconify" data-icon="noto:waving-hand-medium-dark-skin-tone"></span></p>

description: Having written poetry for 18 years, my skills as a poet have improved greatly. I take a trip down memory lane discussing some of my poems from the past.

In between starting a new job, supporting the web design needs of a local non-profit, [HALLINS Corporation](https://www.hallinscorp.com), and even dealing with a surprise paperback purchase (which was awesome once I realized the email wasn't spam :sweat_smile:), I've haven't had much time to write for me. Granted, I have not been the most inspired to write creatively, as mentioned in my last post. However, I decided to open up the file where I keep all my poetry, mainly to fix some formatting issues. The seemingly absent-minded task transformed into a trip into my past as I reminisced on the topics, styles, and quality of my poetry.

The earliest poem that I have saved was from 2002 entitled "Today is the Day." I donâ€™t have the month or day unfortunately, but I do remember being in school, starting my first year of junior high (7th grade). I originally shared the poem with my family during dinner or right after it and they liked it, encouraging me to continue writing. It's about a runner training, winning, and remembering a race they entered. Looking back at it now, it isn't the best poem. :shrug: But, it was a start.

For the last 18 years, I have written at least one poem each year. Some years only have two or three poems where others contain dozens. Seeing how poetry was my main source of de-stressing for years, you can easily tell when life got a bit crazy. Some of my best poems were between the years of 2013-2015 where I was dealing with difficult changes in my friendships and romantic relationships. These poems are quite personal and only a handful have been read by others. Those poems I didn't write to share but to release the turbulent emotions dwelling inside me. I'm not the best at verbally expressing my feelings, so written word it is then. :writing:

One of my favorite poems from that time is "Returned Jackets", a tribute to the men, or "jackets", that a friend and I had left behind without continuing onto marrying them, i.e. the final purchase. My friend loved it at the time and despite its age, I think it still holds up pretty well.

> We've returned our jackets, my friend and I.  
> We both changed our minds right before the buy,  
> or rather the jackets somewhat forced our hands.  
> See, further research revealed some things about the brands.  
> Her former brand was great with her shape flaunted and caressed,  
> until the poor thing started unraveling due to being highly stressed.  
> Mine was pretty nice too but with some spots here and there,  
> but despite washing, the spots became far too big and ugly to wear.
>
> So, we are free, happy, and jacket-less.  
> Window shopping is actually fun again. Oh yes!  
> The styles of jackets have all sorts of colors and sizes  
> and the availability changes with the sunrises.  
> We admire the pretty ones, the cool ones, and the slick,  
> careful to avoid the pricey ones who would weigh us down like bricks.  
> Sometimes, my friend hopes her old favorite becomes free again.  
> But me, we both deserve better, especially now compared to then.  
> I sometimes doubt I will ever find one that actually fits.  
> But then she reminds me of Jah, saying on him to never call quits.  
> Nevertheless, until we both receive our personalized rewards,  
> we have each other, jacket-less and never bored!

The one thing that I find ironic is that I have only written five poems this year even though life has been a dumpster fire for the past few months. :shrug: I have missed writing poetry though and my sister gave me a suggestion of writing a poem a week, whatever subject or styles I want, as a way to jumpstart my creativity again. It's a good idea, one that I'll be starting this month. Feel free to take it if you feel like you're in a creative rut. If you have gotten out a rut recently, what worked for you? The more ideas, the better for me. Until next time!

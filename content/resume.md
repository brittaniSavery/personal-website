# Resume

"Coder. Writer. Gamer. Nerd." is the tagline for my website and email signature, identifying the main portions of my personality. "Coder" is listed first due to my childhood spent in front of and surrounded by computers, which I discuss in [Part 1](/post/intro-of-me-the-coder) of my introduction posts. My education and profession as a software developer simply solidified that particular ID. Peruse through my professional resume if you're curious or if you're looking to hire a freelancer; I am available to work. :smile:

# Resume

"Coder. Writer. Gamer. Nerd." is the tagline for my website and email signature, identifying the main portions of my personality. "Coder" is listed first due to my childhood spent in front of and surrounded by computers, which I discuss in [Part 1](/post/intro-of-me-the-coder) of my introduction posts. My education and profession as a software developer simply solidified that particular ID. Peruse through my professional resume! There is a [.pdf version](/brittani-s-avery-resume.pdf){download} as well.

If you're looking to hire a freelancer, I am available to work. Please [book time with me](https://app.simplymeet.me/brittanisavery/project-consultation) and let's talk about your project. :smile:

Have you ever found really old stuff while cleaning or organizing a room? I know I do often. It happened again when I was organizing my office's closet.

> I am a girl who has reddish brown hair and speak my mind  
> I wonder what tomorrow will bring  
> I hear my little brother crying because he doesn't want to brush his teeth  
> I see my little sister playing dress-up and think she's a famous movie star  
> I want life to be exciting and not boring like some of my classes  
> I am a girl who has reddish brown hair and speak my mind
>
> I pretend that I'm a world famous soccer player and score 6 goals every game  
> I feel like I'm floating in the air  
> I touch my dog's warm, fuzzy fur  
> I worry about my family a lot  
> I cry when I'm hurt, angry, and sad  
> I am a girl who has reddish brown hair and speak my mind
>
> I understand what it feels like to be in a new place  
> I say that we're all equal  
> I dream about traveling all around the world and going to exotic places  
> I try to give 100%
> I hope that one day the world will find great peace  
> I am a girl who has reddish brown hair and speak my mind

> I am a black dot on a white sheet of paper.  
> I wonder when they will stop.  
> I hear them snicker.  
> I see them point at me.  
> I am a black dot on a white sheet of paper.
>
> I pretend that I am deaf and blind so I cannot hear or see them.  
> I feel sad and alone in there because I am.  
> I touch the doorknob, knowing they are there.  
> I cry on the inside when I am around them.  
> I am a black dot on a white sheet of paper.
>
> I understand what it feels like to be in a new place  
> I say "la la la la la" to tune them out.  
> I dream about the summer and never having to see them again.  
> I try to ignore them, but it never works.  
> I hope that one day soon they will stop.  
> I am a black dot on a white sheet of paper.

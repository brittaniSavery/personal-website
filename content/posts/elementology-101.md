description: Elementology, the main science and plot driver within my Element Unknown series, was born from a love of psychology, personality tests, and the classic elements.

In the world of [_Element Unknown_](/book/element-unknown) and its upcoming sequel, elementology is the science that brings sense to the fact that people can shot fire balls out of their hands, read the thoughts of others, shift into shadows, and even fly. The best definition of this science is found at the beginning of chapter nine of _Element Unknown_:

> Elementology, the study of the classic elements, and their effects on sentient beings, is a relatively new science. The classic elements of Fire, Water, Earth, and Air were considered the building blocks of the world until the discovery of chemical elements. Yet, despite being discredited as critical for life’s existence, these four classic elements have played vital roles in entertainment, literature, and pop culture for centuries. It appeared as if that pattern would continue for as long as sentient beings remained on this planet. But the Great Cataclysm, the event during which myth became reality and fantasy creatures became our everyday neighbors, changed that for all.

Breaking down the four main elements into their corresponding personality traits is pretty simple.

- :earth: **Earth:** There is a common saying among various cultures of _Element Unknown_: "If you want the truth, ask an Earth." Earths are the rational, impartial deep thinkers, always standing with truth. They are naturally shy and only are placed in leadership positions when no one else will step up. Yet, they do not make the best leaders, usually being indecisive and socially awkward. They also aren't the quickest to make changes. Rather, they tend to resist changes, especially if they deem them unnecessary.
- :fire: **Fire:** The line between lover and fighter is pretty thin for Fires. They love hard and are full of passion, which can sometimes get them into trouble by being too flirtatious. They're natural leaders and physically and mentally durable, making them perfect for politics or the military. Yet, they can be quick-tempered, impulsive, and rather blunt. There isn't a lot of checks and balances with Fires.
- :water: **Water:** Just like a river flowing peacefully, Waters are calm, soft-spoken people. They are drawn toward the arts, especially the visual or literary arts, or the occupations that help others. Emotions are both their strength and their weakness, allowing themselves to be easily hurt or taken advantage of. When hurt, they turn cold-blooded and hold some of the harshest grudges.
- :air: **Air:** These are the social butterflies of the four, loving to be the center of attention. They tend to be natural performers and often seek occupations that allow them to interact with others. In friend groups, they are almost always the bubbly, energetic friend. Some of their negative qualities are their flightiness and narcissistic nature. With an Air around, there is rarely a dull moment.

The process in creating this system took time, research, and feedback from close friends and family. It went through some iterations through the first draft of _Element Unknown_ and has only evolved further during the writing of its sequel. I hope to shed a little bit of light onto the inspiration and creation of elementology.

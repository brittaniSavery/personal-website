This is the code for my personal website, [brittanisavery.com](https://brittanisavery.com). Originally the site was created using the WYSIWYG builder provided by [wix.com](https://wix.com). However, after a redesign, I noticed that editing the site as well as adding new entries to my blog took much longer than before. Therefore, I decided to build my own site using the skills I have picked up as a software developer.

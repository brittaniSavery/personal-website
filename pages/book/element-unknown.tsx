            Fifteen-year-old Rex Marshall, son of a high government official,
            doesn&apos;t seem to belong to the upper class society of the
            affluent country, Maventa. While trying to prove his maturity to
            take over the family inheritance, life takes an unexpected turn as
            he frees a strange looking slave with a unique connection to him and
            begins to develop new elemental powers.

            Environmental details were well-written, the sub-plots involving
            Meenal and Rex trying to learn about their backgrounds was
            intriguing.
